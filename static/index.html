        <h1>Welcome to Phonograph!</h1>

        <p>Phonograph is an application that determines the relationships between musical acts.
            If two musical acts are related via one or more collaborations, Phonograph will display
            the relationship with the fewest number of collaborations between the two artists.
            Two musical acts have collaborated if they have appeared on the same song.
